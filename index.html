                    she is or where
                    sheve gone. The only thing we know so far is that there is a strange light in the nothern sky
                    but
                    we have yet to figure that out.

                    We have found her in some cave with a lot of
                    writing

                    She has found what shes looking for but there is some kind of
                    animal guarding it.
                    She has never read about this kind of animal before its so dangorous but so cute at the same
                    time
                    but she has no time to think because this animal is running ready to attack. She dodges and
                    looks at
                    what shes been looking for.....

                    feelings of others and radinates happines at will.
                    but they all have diffrent unique abilities that we have yet to figure out.
